			In February of 2016, Caroline Chin and Kamilla Tekiela released <i>The Status of Undergraduate Women at MIT</i> report. This report contained important information about the undergraduate experience. It revealed that the MIT experience is quite different between men and women.
			</p>
		<p>
			 However the report was a bulky 70 page PDF, containing mostly text. From informal polling, it is clear that very few people have read the report or even know of its existence. For our final project, we attempted to present the information revealed in the report in a more visual and visceral way. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Here, we present an interactive exploration of the report. Our target audience includes all undergraduate students. Specifically, undergraduates who have not read the full report. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Our call to action is presented to the viewer at the end of the interactive visual. We implore students who were unaware of the inequality in undergraduate experiences between men and women to inform the administration of these differences. Specifically, students can write a public letter to the brand new Vice President of Student life, here: <a href="https://welcomesuzy.wordpress.com/write/">https://welcomesuzy.wordpress.com/write/</a>.
